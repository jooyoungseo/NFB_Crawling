Lanie,

I am happy to see you are reaching out to all the possible resources you can for help in this. I am unsure where to reply to you but I will post the answer to this question here. 

The answer is no you are not going to be able to use JavaScript libraries in  your C++ code. If you were developing JavaScript code you would b able to make calls to C++ functions but you are not going to be able to do this in reverse. The plattform is different. JavaScript is web based and executed through the web browser. C++ is a compiler language and requires interaction with the operating system to run. 

I will be responding to your other questions in other places in a few minutes.

Hi, I know it's been forever since I posted to this list. I'm wondering if
there are any other microsoft programmers on here who are dabbling in web
programming? I'm looking to update my skills. Currently we have an intranet
at work that I have made that is using web forms and code everywhere etc.
that I think will gradually be replaced with something. We are using
winapps also and I find that preferable because there is less visual stuff
to deal with, but I would like to dabble in web developmet etc. as well,
including some of the new javascript things in part to prove they can be
accessible. Is there anyone else travelling down this path, have you used
any of the frameworks, etc. Is visual studio better for accessibility now?
Any good training resources? Anyone to comiserate with? :) Thanks for
reading this rambly message and for any help you can provide.

	For javascript, I just use a plain text editor. It does not complete
what I type or fix indentation, but the tools that we have for code
management do that. It does not have any bells and whistles.

Hi Chris,

I was a web developer  up until about 2 years ago, so I'm a bit rusty.  I
used the Visual Studio IDE to create ASP.NET web apps using quite a few
differentlanguages, frameworks, and tools, including MVC, Web API,
Javascript, and XML/XSLT among others.  I can speak a bit to VS
accessibility  but it's one of those things where MS can always improve.

Is there a specific project you have in mind?

Thanks,
Dan

Subject: [nfbcs] Speech on Demand Frustrations
Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.2.21.9.1803091722450.18315@server2.shellworld.net>

Hello everyone:

The subject says it in a nutshell. I'm finding that I don't like this new 
speech on demand feature in Jaws. The ability to totally turn speech 
on/off has been severely hampered or removed completely. I now work in a 
cubicle setting where I don't necessarily want my time or title bar 
announced. I have made the unfortunate decision not to install Jaws 2018 
on my office PC due to this new feature. I've also found that full speech 
often comes back on when there is a major screen change.

The bottom line is that I want to be in control of my screen reader. I 
found the ability to turn speech on/off essential, but it has been taken 
away from me. I hope deaf-blind users are aware of this change since they 
may not be able to hear their computer talk at all. If speech on demand is 
such a valuable feature, I don't understand why it wouldn't have been 
built in as a layered command. So, when you press insert-s, you would get
three choices instead of two. But what do I know, right?

What are others thoughts on this? Am I the only one not liking this new 
feature?

Hello everyone.
What are the variants for accessible  reference management software?
I'm interested in applications such as  Zotero, Mendeley, EndNote and the like that are accessible for screenreaders.
Which of the products in this class meet these requirements?

I have had the opposite problem with lack of accessibility where sighted people at universities tried to set up computers set it jaws cannot work. For example, it would leave their computers on mute and say there was nothing they could do about it because that was just how their system works. And the fact that I was not receiving speech during major screen changes was a problem for me. If you want to use a program that only speaks sometimes, maybe try Zoom text or something else.

Hi Sabra:

In my opinion, the speech on demand feature is designed for people with 
low vision who still use the mouse. I am a Braille display user and don't 
see the its benefit. I was having a problem turning speech off completely 
when needed. Many Braille display users do this so they can work with 
their peers in a quieter environment. However, I definitely understand why 
you would be frustrated with sighted people turning Jaws off. I just 
wanted to make sure you understood my dilemma. I could not use ZoomText if 
you paid me, but I prefer Braille only most of the time.

Have you talked  to anyone in charge of accommodations? It is a reasonable accommodation to unmute a computer with a screen reader on it. I would keep moving up the chain of command until I found someone with access to the volume mixer.

I use it and like it.? As an amateur radio operator, it's great to be 
able to use braille with the computer while listening to the radio.

I am out of school now, but while I was in school, their solution was that I had to wait until a lab assistant was available to unmute the computer. Sometimes I needed to use the school computers because they had special software on them and because they had windows and I had a Mac. They had to get jaws on one of the computers for me and that was the one I was supposed to use. However, the computer was always muted. I finally complained about this enough that they put a note on the computer I was supposed to use that other people just had to leave it alone. I don't understand why they could not just have added a shortcut to Enu the computer or work something else out though. Even if people left that computer alone, it would still be muted if it ever had to be restarted for any reason. This was also the case at my first university except there, I never did get it resolved. It took me 15 or 20 minutes to get logged in because I had to wait until a lab assistant was available. The lab assistants at my first university were never the same, and it took forever to get them two unmute the computer. At my first university, jaws also would not start up until after you were logged in. And at my first university, The computers would freeze up and just stop talking. This happened a lot in one particular location. NVDA was being used there, but jaws would do it too. Back then, we did not have speech on the man that I know of, and I really wish that we had. I also like how these new version of jaws will override the computer's mute feature. At my first university when I complained about the whole thing, they said just to be patient. It isn't really about being patient though even if the process was quick. It is about the fact that a sighted person had to be a gatekeeper to whether I could use the computer when other students did not have a gatekeeper. I am so glad to be out of school now. I never want to go back. The environment at both of my universities was so hostile for me as a blind student. I would not wish that environment even on someone I disliked. It was very detrimental, and now I have really bad anxiety to the point where I can't write anymore or do the things that I used to be able to do. I have always been sensitive to loud noises. Whenever a loud noise comes, I feel like I am being stabbed. Not exactly like being stabbed, but I don't know any other way to describe it. I guess it is kind of a mixture between a stab, electrical shock, and a throbbing sensation that sort of Terrace through my body. But anyways, I used to be able to tolerate loud noises even though it would take a large amount of my energy to do so, but as my anxiety increased, I could not tolerate loud noises more and more to the point where I had to wait until night time to go to the grocery store and I had to mostly avoid environments like the mall. My friend introduced me to these special type of earplugs that I now have to use in these environments, but it is better to be able to use that your plugs and still be able to go there. I was supposed to get my Bachelors in computer information systems, but I switched to business management at the last minute so I could get out a semester early. I thought that while I was in school I realized how difficult it was, but I now realize that I did not fully understand how harmful of environment I wasn't until I got out. I am now looking for a job, but school took everything out of me to the point that I really can't do anything anymore, so I don't know how I will be able to work. I used to have so much energy and be able to do so many things, but not anymore. I worked so hard to get this degree because I thought it would up my job prospects, but now I am thinking that getting that degree was not worth it because of what it did to me. Everyone else talked about school as though it was so great and they found themselves and they decided what they wanted to do all of this exciting stuff. But yes, I do not have to worry about a computer being neutered or not because I am now out of school and jobless. I don't even know what I want to do anymore because I don't feel excited about anything the way I used to. I'm just kind of applying for everything and hoping that something find me and maybe I will get excited for it once I am doing it. I had hoped to become an author and finally publish my novel, but I can't because I can't right. You might say that I am writing right now, but I would argue that this message is very disorganized. Also, going off preestablished patterns that have been drawn into my mind is not the same as being able to create something good without a pattern the way I used to be able to.

I was having a problem turning speech off completely when needed. Many Braille display users do this so they can work with their peers in a quieter environment. However, I definitely understand why you would be frustrated with sighted people turning Jaws off. I just wanted to make sure you understood my dilemma. I could not use ZoomText if you paid me, but I prefer Braille only most of the time.

I have been a jaws user for years and lately on 2 of my systems I have 
switched intirely to NVDA.  On my other 2 systems I have both and find it 
quite usefull.  If you are liking the features in jaws I would advise you to 
give nvda a try.  It will not cost you anything to try.

Subject: [nfbcs] Speech on Demand Frustrations

Hello everyone:

The subject says it in a nutshell. I'm finding that I don't like this new
speech on demand feature in Jaws. The ability to totally turn speech
on/off has been severely hampered or removed completely. I now work in a
cubicle setting where I don't necessarily want my time or title bar
announced. I have made the unfortunate decision not to install Jaws 2018
on my office PC due to this new feature. I've also found that full speech
often comes back on when there is a major screen change.

The bottom line is that I want to be in control of my screen reader. I
found the ability to turn speech on/off essential, but it has been taken
away from me. I hope deaf-blind users are aware of this change since they
may not be able to hear their computer talk at all. If speech on demand is
such a valuable feature, I don't understand why it wouldn't have been
built in as a layered command. So, when you press insert-s, you would get
three choices instead of two. But what do I know, right?

What are others thoughts on this? Am I the only one not liking this new
feature?

Message-ID: <CALhu1LfGRHf3SZCFsQNZOoB-Y7voYqFpvXTFj8SQOmgEiOz_Dg@mail.gmail.com>

I currently work in enterprise technical support management. I've always
had an interest in software development, and am intending to learn to
program in order to diversify my skill set a little bit.

I had been working through freecodecamp before I found out I was losing my
vision to RP as web development is very big in my local job market. I am
wondering now if web development as a specialization still makes sense or
if I should focus on a different programming language, like C# (since I
hear Visual Studio is more accessible than most IDEs). My central vision
still works but I don't want to count on that for my professional future,
and I'm dealing with some eye fatigue issues that is motivating me to learn
JAWS asap.

Is there any particular programming specialization that is more or less
accessible than others? My current role I can do without vision, but I
still want to learn to program.

If web development is your interest then I would pursue it.  

If your concerned about losing what vision you've got left, I would suggest
looking into server-side technologies, rather than client-side.  But it's
always good to know something about HTML and Javascript.  In my experience,
employers are looking for "jacks-of-all-trades" rather than specialists,
unless the specialization is hightly technical.

I live in MS's backyard so there's a lot of C# development in this area.
But that may not be the case for you.  Learn what is valuable where you
live.

Visual studio may be accessible, but the documentation definitely isn't. There is very scarce documentation specifically designed for screen reader users, and if you are not used to an environment like that, it is not very intuitive. It is not like, oh, I can't remember the shortcut so I will find it in the menus. You either know the shortcut or it's a no go as far as visual studio is concerned because they allow you to get around with shortcut keys, but when I was using it, I was never able to access any menus or ribbons like in word or another program that is made by Microsoft. Also, I don't mean offense by this, but many of the blind people who have documentation in their brains about how to use it that they got from the nose where, have not bothered to write a manual for the rest of us, and can be very hottie exclusive where this knowledge is concerned. If you already know a lot about programming though, you might have better luck using it. I personally think that web development might be better because you can have stylesheets and HTML really is not that hard. The only problem you might have is with graphics, but you might not even have that problem since you used to be cited. However, visual studio allows you to make websites as well. They were doing that in my visual basic class. The good thing about visual studio is if you can get it to work, you can easily move controls around on the screen. It has a coordinate system, which no one at my university could tell me how to work and I could not find this information online, but if you can figure out how to work that coordinate system, you can put controls wherever you want.

Subject: [nfbcs] request for donation for NFB STEM scholarship 2018

Hello,

The National Federation of the BLIND NFB is a wonderful organization.
I am the president of the Science and Engineering Division of NFB.
We are a small group working to help blind scientists and engineers.
Please consider making a donation to the NFB towards the NFB STEM Scholarship.

The NFB STEM Scholarship is jointly funded by the Science and Engineering Division and the NFB in Computer Science Division.

The NFB in Computer Science Division (NFBCS) consists of blind computer professionals and other individuals with a shared interest in computer technology. NFBCS members work together to develop strategies that enable blind people to use and manipulate computers more efficiently and competitively.

This year, the NFB in Computer Science Division started off our fundraising with a generous donation of $200 for which I am very grateful.

In order to make a donation to the NFB STEM Scholarship, make a check payable to NFB.
On the memo line write STEM Scholarship.
Mail the check to
NFB accounting/scholarship
200 East Wells St. at Jernigan Place
Baltimore, MD 21230.

We are raising funds for a $3000 or $5000 scholarship given to a worthy student at the NFB convention.

We will determine the amount awarded based on funds raised.
We have raised $3365 with a goal of $6000. We have achieved 56% of our goal and have $2635 more to go. A goal of $6000 allows us to have a small balance to help with 2019 fundraising.



NFB gives about 30 scholarships each year.
I was fortunate enough to receive a NFB scholarship as a graduating senior in high school.
I received a second NFB scholarship during my second year of my PH.D program at UC San Diego.

The NFB STEM Scholarship goes to a legally blind individual who will be in a fulltime US college or graduate program in fall of 2018.
The individual must be studying a major in the fields of science, engineering, technology, or mathematics.
You can read about the scholarship application at www.nfb.org/scholarships<http://www.nfb.org/scholarships>.
Our division was able to give a scholarship in 2017 in the amount of $3,000 to Rachel Wellington who was beginning her college program in biology.

Rachel wrote to the division and said "Any financial assistance is greatly appreciated." She hopes to obtain a degree in biology from the University of Georgia.
We have been asked to complete our fundraising by May 1 in order to award a scholarship at the NFB convention in July.
Any funds that we raise in excess of $5,000 will be awarded in a future year.
I am really excited about the scholarship and am looking forward to meeting the enthusiastic blind student who will be the winner.

Thank you for all of your help and your kind consideration.

Very Best,

John Miller, President

Science and Engineering Division

of the National Federation of the Blind

Visual studio may be accessible, but the documentation definitely isn't.
There is very scarce documentation specifically designed for screen reader
users, and if you are not used to an environment like that, it is not very
intuitive. It is not like, oh, I can't remember the shortcut so I will find
it in the menus. You either know the shortcut or it's a no go as far as
visual studio is concerned because they allow you to get around with
shortcut keys, but when I was using it, I was never able to access any menus
or ribbons like in word or another program that is made by Microsoft. Also,
I don't mean offense by this, but many of the blind people who have
documentation in their brains about how to use it that they got from the
nose where, have not bothered to write a manual for the rest of us, and can
be very hottie exclusive where this knowledge is concerned. If you already
know a lot about programming though, you might have better luck using it. I
personally think that web development might be better because you can have
stylesheets and HTML really is not that hard. The only problem you might
have is with graphics, but you might not even have that problem since you
used to be cited. However, visual studio allows you to make websites as
well. They were doing that in my visual basic class. The good thing about
visual studio is if you can get it to work, you can easily move controls
around on the screen. It has a coordinate system, which no one at my
university could tell me how to work and I could not find this information
online, but if you can figure out how to work that coordinate system, you

Lots of blind devs know and/or use it well. If you want to do any kind
of IOS development, which is really important in the industry and
consists of a large portion of jobs out there. ObjectiveC and/or Swift
are no more visual than other languages... Many people made that claim
about Python too.

Most tutorials I?ve seen about developing iPhone apps talk about dragging and dropping things in Xcode. That seems pretty visual to me. You can use HTML and JavaScript to develop smart phone apps. Check out phonegap.com. If there is a tutorial that would show me how to develop apps just by writing swift code I would like to know about it.

            It does not have to be, but many people who teach it teach it in a visual way that involves moving things around and drawing. I don?t remember the specifics, but I ended up dropping out of a class in college because the professor was teaching it in the visual way. Sorry if that came across wrong?just more of a warning if people plan to take a class on it.

I guess my issue with the statement is that "many people who teach it do
x," because one college course was that way. Java was taught visually
too. "Make this GUI, use this editor (which isn't accessible), but that
doesn't mean that Java specifically shouldn't be learned. IOS
development can be visual if you go that route and design GUIs, but it's
such a large percentage and most shops will have a UX/UI person that you
can probably get away with just backend work and it's worth learning.
Mobile development makes up a huge portion of the current industry and
when I was doing my job searching I ran into a lot of hybrid jobs.

Lots of gui-based applications and development shows you dr agging and
dropping things. Welcome to being blind, we're required to find all
kinds of solutions to things and learn how to use our assistive
technology to accomplish what we want. There is a way using Voiceover to
drag and drop, and there is even an article online that explains how to
do most of what you would need.

Visual studio may be accessible, but the documentation definitely isn't.
There is very scarce documentation specifically designed for screen reader

be very hottie exclusive where this knowledge is concerned. If you already
know a lot about programming though, you might have better luck using it. I
personally think that web development might be better because you can have
stylesheets and HTML really is not that hard. The only problem you might
have is with graphics, but you might not even have that problem since you
used to be cited. However, visual studio allows you to make websites as
well. They were doing that in my visual basic class. The good thing about
visual studio is if you can get it to work, you can easily move controls
around on the screen. It has a coordinate system, which no one at my
university could tell me how to work and I could not find this information
online, but if you can figure out how to work that coordinate system, you
can put controls wherever you want.

Where I live, server backend and web development are the hot topics in industry. Any web developer job will require extensive use of html/css/php/javascript or javascript library, not just backend work. It isn't good enough to write php or python libraries or backend web services, you also have to build the frontend. The only exception is where industry draws a fine line between web developer and web designer. Web designers have to know Photoshop, Illustrator, or some other graphics designer package. Web designers also have to understand the fundamentals of how images store binary code, advanced topics on image compression types, and an extensive amount of CSS. Web developers must know an extensive amount of backend/frontend programming languages, a fair amount of CSS, and HTML 5. Web developers don't focus on the visual appeal as much as the functunality/feature sets of the website in question.

I guess my issue with the statement is that "many people who teach it do x," because one college course was that way. Java was taught visually too. "Make this GUI, use this editor (which isn't accessible), but that doesn't mean that Java specifically shouldn't be learned. IOS development can be visual if you go that route and design GUIs, but it's such a large percentage and most shops will have a UX/UI person that you can probably get away with just backend work and it's worth learning.
Mobile development makes up a huge portion of the current industry and when I was doing my job searching I ran into a lot of hybrid jobs.

It is a warning for blind students to be prepared to write their GUI by hand, not drag/drop. Most professors could care if students drag/drop or write it by hand. In fact, my graduate level Java textbook taught writing GUIs by hand, not drag/drop. The author's point is just the subject we are talking about. Besides, what happens if a drag/drop interface builder wrote code wrong or in a way you didn't prefer? If you learn writing it by hand, then it is much easier to spot something wrong or different than your primary coding style. Furthermore, I have found that getting in the routine of writing by hand makes cleaner code, and can get things done faster than sighted peers. While they are dragging/droping and clicking around, we are typing away with a set goal in mind. Most professors don't care what Java editor students use. As long as you tell the professor which one you use, and that editor is opensource/free, he or she can download it. Thus, inaccessible editors aren't even a factor.

The textbook I am talking about is Java how to program, 10th ed. Early objects version by Deitel and Deitel.

            It does not have to be, but many people who teach it teach it in a visual way that involves moving things around and drawing.

Lots of blind devs know and/or use it well. If you want to do any kind of IOS development, which is really important in the industry and consists of a large portion of jobs out there. ObjectiveC and/or Swift are no more visual than other languages... Many people made that claim about Python too.

Visual studio may be accessible, but the documentation definitely isn't.
There is very scarce documentation specifically designed for screen reader users, and if you are not used to an environment like that, it is not very intuitive. It is not like, oh, I can't remember the shortcut so I will find it in the menus. You either know the shortcut or it's a no go as far as visual studio is concerned because they allow you to get around with shortcut keys, but when I was using it, I was never able to access any menus or ribbons like in word or another program that is made by Microsoft. Also, I don't mean offense by this, but many of the blind people who have documentation in their brains about how to use it that they got from the nose where, have not bothered to write a manual for the rest of us, and can be very hottie exclusive where this knowledge is concerned. If you already know a lot about programming though, you might have better luck using it. I personally think that web development might be better because you can have stylesheets and HTML really is not that hard.

The best way is to adapt your thought process to the sighted person's world. Find ways to do things visually, then resort to alternatives when that fails to work.

Most tutorials I?ve seen about developing iPhone apps talk about dragging and dropping things in Xcode. That seems pretty visual to me. You can use HTML and JavaScript to develop smart phone apps. Check out phonegap.com. If there is a tutorial that would show me how to develop apps just by writing swift code I would like to know about it.

I use all sorts of IDEs from Android Studio, Visual Studio, SSMS (SQL Server
Management Studio), VS Code to PHP Storm, Eclipse, notepad, and InteliJ for
Java. All of them are accessible as long as you consider secondary methods
to get a job done in case the primary method isn't accessible. For instance,
use NVDA 2018.1 for any apps that require Swing for the UI. This narrows the
list down to Android Studio and PHP Storm. VS Code is accessible with any
screen reader. However, autocomplete works best with NVDA. Visual Studio
works best with any screen reader, especially since Microsoft created
codetalks plugin for Visual Studio. Don't just give up on something if you
haven't tried it. In fact, I like PHP Storm better with
html/css/javascript/php because the autocomplete feature has proven itself
reliable, especially with bootstrap declarations and attributes.

Visual studio may be accessible, but the documentation definitely isn't.
There is very scarce documentation specifically designed for screen reader
users, and if you are not used to an environment like that, it is not very
intuitive. It is not like, oh, I can't remember the shortcut so I will find
it in the menus. You either know the shortcut or it's a no go as far as
visual studio is concerned because they allow you to get around with
shortcut keys, but when I was using it, I was never able to access any menus
or ribbons like in word or another program that is made by Microsoft. Also,
I don't mean offense by this, but many of the blind people who have
documentation in their brains about how to use it that they got from the
nose where, have not bothered to write a manual for the rest of us, and can
be very hottie exclusive where this knowledge is concerned. If you already
know a lot about programming though, you might have better luck using it. I
personally think that web development might be better because you can have
stylesheets and HTML really is not that hard. The only problem you might
have is with graphics, but you might not even have that problem since you
used to be cited. However, visual studio allows you to make websites as
well. They were doing that in my visual basic class. The good thing about
visual studio is if you can get it to work, you can easily move controls
around on the screen. It has a coordinate system, which no one at my
university could tell me how to work and I could not find this information
online, but if you can figure out how to work that coordinate system, you
can put controls wherever you want.

Andy,


Could you tell me more about how to make IntelliJ IDEs accessible? They 
were my favorites back in the days. But I tried both idea and PyCharm a 
year ago and couldn't figure out anything - they didn't appear 
accessible at all. Did they only recently add accessibility with NVDA 2018?


Thanks

Tony

Subject: [nfbcs] Visual Studio Question
Message-ID: <b3fb92bb-c814-06db-3e3a-1fb7a9fbe032@gmail.com>

Hi, everyone. I have a question about Visual Studio 2017 and was 
wondering if anyone could help. I'm using the Community version. I would 
love to have VS Enterprise, but my college has a weird rule that I think 
is stupid and don't understand. Students studying for a Computer 
Information Technology degree get VS Enterprise and VMWare Workstation 
Pro for free, while Software Engineering students like me don't. I think 
we could use it just as much as CIT majors, so I really don't understand 
why we can't get it for free just like them. Anyway, that's not really 
what I'm asking about. I'm using Visual Studio for all my assignments 
now, and I have one solution for my class that contains all the projects 
I've done or am working on. I know you can press F5 to debug the whole 
solution, but I have over 30 projects, so I don't want to run all of 
them. Is there a keyboard shortcut for debugging only the project you're 
working on? I've looked, but I can't find one, so doing it gets kind of 
tedious, especially when I want to test the project several times in a 
row. I have to switch to the solution explorer, find the project name, 
right-click it, scroll to the debug menu, and then click start new 
instance. I'm just hoping there's a better way. Does anyone know of one? 
Also, let me know if this way of posting to the list works well. I was 
asked a while back not to cross-post to multiple lists since it made 
replying to one difficult, so I'm trying BCC-ing each address instead so 
I don't have to send multiple messages. Thanks.

It's not really a good idea to specialize in one thing as that limits
your job prospects, and a company you might start working for might
move you to another job doing something else if they feel like it.
You also can't know everything.  To be a good software engineer, it's
important to learn the general fundamental cconcepts and ideas, and
then be good at learning new languages and new systems as your job
changes over time.  And lots of jobs will test you on the fundamentals
rather than on one type of specialization.

	Agreed. When I was in college, the required courses had us using at
least three different programming languages; I think that I also learned two
or three more when I took web programming classes. You should also have a
good understanding of the common underlying concepts. You should also be
able to learn new programming languages fairly easily. Some software
companies that use different programming languages have their own in house
documentation/courses or have resources about where on the internet to find
tutorials.

It's not really a good idea to specialize in one thing as that limits your
job prospects, and a company you might start working for might move you to
another job doing something else if they feel like it.
You also can't know everything.  To be a good software engineer, it's
important to learn the general fundamental cconcepts and ideas, and then be
good at learning new languages and new systems as your job changes over
time.  And lots of jobs will test you on the fundamentals rather than on one
type of specialization.

I would be willing to give something if I could do via paypal or some
other online method, but I am not writing a check and mailing it.  I
haven't written a check in 10 years.  This is supposed to be the
computer division.  Why no paypal account?  They are free.

Message-ID: <00ff01d3bbbd$77312980$65937c80$@att.net>

Hello:

 

I am trying to place elements on the screen using css using both the box and
positioning methods. These elements are boxed elements and I need to
manipulate them outside the normal flow. I do exactly what the book says to
do and it will not work. By viewing my css below, does anyone see my
problem? 

 

 

/* surrounds entire page */

.cont{

position: relative;

width: 100%;

height: 100%;

 

}

 

/* within the cont div group. */

.accessible{

position: fixed;

top: 0%;

left:0%;

text-align: center;

 

}

 

/* creates another division within the cont division */

.middle {

position: relative;

top: 0%; /* relative to the accessibility elements */

left: 0%;

right: 0%;

bottom: 55%; /* from bottom of page */

HEIGHT: 40%;

width: 100%;

 

}

 

/* from inside of the .middle division */

.menuLeft {

position: absolute; /* absolute from the .middle top left courner. */

top: 0%;

left: 0%;

right: 80%;

bottom: 0%;

width: 20%;

hight: 100%;

    text-align: left;

 

}

 

/* absolute placement from .middle top left courner */

.textCenter {

position: absolute;

top: 0%;

left: 30%;

right: 0%;

bottom: 0%;

width: 65%;

height: 100%;

    padding: 0%;

margins: 0%;

boarder: none;

 

}

/* .middle ends here on page  */

 

/* new bottom division relative to .middle division */

.bottom {

display: block;

height:40%;

width: 100%;

 

}

 

/* three picture boxes placed beside each other, relative to the other */

.picLeft,

.picMiddle,

.picRight {

display: inline-block;

                width:30%;

height: 100%;

margin:3px;

                

}

/* .bottom division ends here */

 

/* textBottom division is 10% from bottom of .cont division and screen width
by default */

.textBottom{

position: fixed;

 

                bottom: 10%;

text-align: center;            

                

}

/* textbottom division ends here */

/* cont division ends here */

 

Any help would be appreciated.

Hi,

Just out of curiosity, I have used visual basic to also before but how do you click on text box and drag them into proper locations and other objects such as buttons and so forth and drive them to where they need to be with the keyboard

I would love to have VS Enterprise, but my college has a weird rule that I think is stupid and don't understand. Students studying for a Computer Information Technology degree get VS Enterprise and VMWare Workstation Pro for free, while Software Engineering students like me don't. I think we could use it just as much as CIT majors, so I really don't understand why we can't get it for free just like them. Anyway, that's not really what I'm asking about. I'm using Visual Studio for all my assignments now, and I have one solution for my class that contains all the projects I've done or am working on. I know you can press F5 to debug the whole solution, but I have over 30 projects, so I don't want to run all of them. Is there a keyboard shortcut for debugging only the project you're working on? I've looked, but I can't find one, so doing it gets kind of tedious, especially when I want to test the project several times in a row. I have to switch to the solution explorer, find the project name, right-click it, scroll to the debug menu, and then click start new instance. I'm just hoping there's a better way. Does anyone know of one? Also, let me know if this way of posting to the list works well. I was asked a while back not to cross-post to multiple lists since it made replying to one difficult, so I'm trying BCC-ing each address instead so I don't have to send multiple messages. Thanks.

I find myself using the location coordinates rather than trying to drag 
and drop.? For example, if you have a label that requires 70 pixels in 
the X direction, you can locate the associated textbox right after the

I would love to have VS Enterprise, but my college has a weird rule that I think is stupid and don't understand. Students studying for a Computer Information Technology degree get VS Enterprise and VMWare Workstation Pro for free, while Software Engineering students like me don't. I think we could use it just as much as CIT majors, so I really don't understand why we can't get it for free just like them. Anyway, that's not really what I'm asking about. I'm using Visual Studio for all my assignments now, and I have one solution for my class that contains all the projects I've done or am working on. I know you can press F5 to debug the whole solution, but I have over 30 projects, so I don't want to run all of them. Is there a keyboard shortcut for debugging only the project you're working on? I've looked, but I can't find one, so doing it gets kin!

I have to switch to the solution explorer, find the project name, right-click it, scroll to the debug menu, and then click start new instance. I'm just hoping there's a better way. Does anyone know of one? Also, let me know if this way of posting to the list works well. I was asked a while back not to cross-post to multiple lists since it made replying to one difficult, so I'm trying BCC-ing each address instead so I don't have to send multiple messages. Thanks.

I also would be happy to give if there is an only way.  What about setting 
up a gofundme account.

I would be willing to give something if I could do via paypal or some
other online method, but I am not writing a check and mailing it.  I
haven't written a check in 10 years.  This is supposed to be the
computer division.  Why no paypal account?  They are free.

Hi, everyone. This is Lanie Molinar. I'm sending this to a lot of lists 
at once. Some are tech-related, some are related to software 
development, and some are for students. I might have to get a new laptop 
soon and have a few questions. First, let me give you a little 
background info to help you understand what I'm looking for. I'm a 
college student getting a degree in Software Engineering, so I'll be 
working with code and developing things. I also have several 
disabilities and health issues in addition to my blindness, so I can't 
do much physically and spend a lot of my day on the computer doing 
schoolwork, taking surveys for extra money, gaming, and doing lots of 
other stuff. I'm fairly sure that I want a computer with Windows 10, not 
a Mac, although I'm willing to look into a Mac if that seems better. I 
would also be happy with something running Linux. I definitely want 
something new, not used, with plenty of RAM. There are so many options 
that I'm just not sure what to look for or where to get it. Again, I 
also need something that can handle being used all day, gaming, and 
developing software. My family is low-income, so I need to get it from 
somewhere that offers good payment plans. Can anyone give me some advice 
on how to choose a laptop, good places to buy one from, and what I 
should get? For those on software development- related lists, I'm 
interested in what would be best for a developer. I would really 
appreciate any help. Thanks.

I'd never buy a laptop without a SSD.  I just finished a purchase about a
year ago of Lenovo T500 series laptops for myself and both of my parents.  I
ended up replacing the hdd in the laptop with a SSD because I really wasn't
happy with the performance without the SSD.  They ended up replacing theirs
too, for each of their laptops.

Why I bought this 1 was the fact that while it was heavier/larger, it had a
full size keyboard with numeric keypad and was designed to run all day.

Most companies sell both a consumer and corporate series.  The corporate
devices are designed to last longer and be used more frequently.  

The consumer devices tend to have better video cards and the corporate
devices tend to be more upgrade-able.

Our IT shop buys Lenovo for similar reasons.  I did not buy my ram or SSD
from Lenovo but bought these afterwards and added them to the device
manually to save tons on the cost.

Before buying any solid state drive, I'd check based on price for 
similar capacity drives in older technology.  Reason for that is solid 
state drives have failed to live up to their hype and are no more 
reliable than the older technology they try to replace.  At least one 
report to this effect was in the howtogeek.com newsletter but even 
before that, I have a source still working for the Navy who is 
definitely on the side of technical things tell me this as well.

Before buying any solid state drive, I'd check based on price for similar

Agreed, on strange keyboard layouts.  Toshibas sometimes do to.  An app
called sharpkeys is good for remapping some of these.

I'd never buy a laptop without a SSD.  I just finished a purchase about a
year ago of Lenovo T500 series laptops for myself and both of my parents.  I
ended up replacing the hdd in the laptop with a SSD because I really wasn't
happy with the performance without the SSD.  They ended up replacing theirs
too, for each of their laptops.

Why I bought this 1 was the fact that while it was heavier/larger, it had a
full size keyboard with numeric keypad and was designed to run all day.

Most companies sell both a consumer and corporate series.  The corporate
devices are designed to last longer and be used more frequently.  

The consumer devices tend to have better video cards and the corporate
devices tend to be more upgrade-able.

Our IT shop buys Lenovo for similar reasons.  I did not buy my ram or SSD
from Lenovo but bought these afterwards and added them to the device
manually to save tons on the cost.

Hello:

One thing I look for when buying a laptop is a setting in the bios that allows use of the function keys without the fn key. Some laptops require you to use the fn key with a function key to perform a windows or application function. Without it, the function keys control media functions such as volume, play and display settings.

I also enjoy having a button for wi-fi, a mute button and a volume switch if I can get it. 

In my opinion, assistive technology requires more computing power than something running without assistive technology. As well as good processor speed, you want one with fast memory and good drive speed or a solid state drive.

I am not inclined to buy computers from places like Office Depot because I think they tend to sell computers with slower parts such as memory and motherboard. I have had good luck at Best Buy and I appreciate that they give 0% financing for several months, depending on the cost of the machine. Being a developer, you probably also want a numeric keypad on your laptop.

Good luck in your laptop search. The next thing you will probably want to do is remove apps and programs you don't plan to use. Business computers tend to have less unnecessary apps.

	I think that the right solution is to use whatever works for that
person, knowing what problems can arise and being prepared for those
problems.

	Yes...a computer running a screen reader, particularly one that is
being used for development, should have 16 GB ram.
	I like Best Buy, too, especially since I can use the Geek Squad,
which costs extra, but I can get troubleshooting and repairs when I need
them.

Subject: Re: [nfbcs] Choosing a Laptop

Hello:

One thing I look for when buying a laptop is a setting in the bios that
allows use of the function keys without the fn key. Some laptops require you
to use the fn key with a function key to perform a windows or application
function. Without it, the function keys control media functions such as
volume, play and display settings.

I also enjoy having a button for wi-fi, a mute button and a volume switch if
I can get it. 

In my opinion, assistive technology requires more computing power than
something running without assistive technology. As well as good processor
speed, you want one with fast memory and good drive speed or a solid state
drive.

I am not inclined to buy computers from places like Office Depot because I
think they tend to sell computers with slower parts such as memory and
motherboard. I have had good luck at Best Buy and I appreciate that they
give 0% financing for several months, depending on the cost of the machine.
Being a developer, you probably also want a numeric keypad on your laptop.

Good luck in your laptop search. The next thing you will probably want to do
is remove apps and programs you don't plan to use. Business computers tend
to have less unnecessary apps.

I agree that more memory is better, but I don't think the mere fact that 
you're running a screen reader, especially something like NVDA, which 
doesn't have an off screen model, means that you need 16G of memory. I'd 
say you could get away with 4G if you're just surfing the web and 
checking email, but 8G would be better. I ran with 8G quite happily for 
a while, and what drove me to getting 8G over 4G was the fact that I was 
running another OS in a virtual machine. My current lapttop has 16G of 
memory, and I went with the greater amount of memory to give me room to 
do more with development and virtual machines. Plus I got a good deal on 
this laptop. I'm not sure if I would have sprung for the extra memory if 
it would have cost me $200 more to get it.

My HP Envy has this setting in BIOS. The Dell I use at work has a hot 
key that let's you toggle your function key mode between classic 
function key behavior and multimedia support.

I don't notice a great deal of difference in performance between my home 
computer which has a 2TB spinning drive and the computer I use at the 
office, which has a 128G SSD drive. I know the SSD is faster, but it 
isn't fast enough that I notice it as I'm using my computer. I assume 
that's because the increase in performance is masked by things like 
caching, the operating system, screen reader and so on.


The one thing I do notice is that the battery life on my laptop with an 
SSD drive is amazing. I can basically go all 8 hours in the office 
without needing an outlet.


BTW, I went with a spinning drive on my personal lapttop because I 
wanted room to run and store multiple virtual machines, and I didn't 
want to pay the money needed to get a 512G SSD drive or larger. I was 
also a bit worried about the performance of running a virtual machine 
from a external drive.

I agree that more memory is better, but I don't think the mere fact that
you're running a screen reader, especially something like NVDA, which
doesn't have an off screen model, means that you need 16G of memory. I'd say
you could get away with 4G if you're just surfing the web and checking
email, but 8G would be better. I ran with 8G quite happily for a while, and
what drove me to getting 8G over 4G was the fact that I was running another
OS in a virtual machine. My current lapttop has 16G of memory, and I went
with the greater amount of memory to give me room to do more with
development and virtual machines. Plus I got a good deal on this laptop. I'm
not sure if I would have sprung for the extra memory if it would have cost
me $200 more to get it.

	It also depends on what other programs you are using. If you wanted
to use Firefox with several windows open, Outlook with several thousand
emails, and Microsoft Word all at the same time, then you might want more
memory. Finally, some of the background programs, like antivirus programs,
can take up memory depending on how much you want them to do.

I agree that more memory is better, but I don't think the mere fact that
you're running a screen reader, especially something like NVDA, which
doesn't have an off screen model, means that you need 16G of memory. I'd say
you could get away with 4G if you're just surfing the web and checking
email, but 8G would be better. I ran with 8G quite happily for a while, and
what drove me to getting 8G over 4G was the fact that I was running another
OS in a virtual machine. My current lapttop has 16G of memory, and I went
with the greater amount of memory to give me room to do more with
development and virtual machines. Plus I got a good deal on this laptop. I'm
not sure if I would have sprung for the extra memory if it would have cost
me $200 more to get it.

8 gigs is a good amount for most standard usage.

Having the extra memory will allow you to run virtual PCs inside your
existing 1.  If you are in Comp.Sci this can be really useful if you want to
plany around with and test things without screwing up your main OS.

I went with 24 gigs of RAM but I run VMs of Linux, Windows and Android on my
pc.

Message-ID: <CABKqQvEML+Ge5GPLsiU3j5v3=dFjgfak722khPPshaJwF6_hYA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

Do any of you have experience with IBM's Watson Content Hub, or with
their website in general?

Their site says, "Watson Content Hub uses the latest W3C Standard,
WAI-ARIA 1.0 to ensure compliance to US Section 508, and Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0..."

Yet I can't even access videos for their online course and I always
have problems using the site.
They haven't responded to requests for help in weeks. What's going on?

Hi Nikita,

In my experience, using LaTeX alongside BibTeX is the only completely accessible reference management option for screenreader users. This is unfortunate because the learning curve is high. I briefly tried endnote, zotero, and mendely, and found endnote to be more accessible than either mendeley or zotero. Take this with a grain of salt however, because I already new LaTeX and quickly switched over to LaTeX/BibTeX when I encountered accessibility issues with endnote/zotero/mendeley. Others likely have additional suggestions. 

Kevin

Hello everyone.
What are the variants for accessible  reference management software?
I'm interested in applications such as  Zotero, Mendeley, EndNote and the like that are accessible for screenreaders.
Which of the products in this class meet these requirements?
Sincerely, Nikita.

Hello,

Keep in mind when you read this that I use Mac + Safari + Voiceover.

I personally use zotero because there is a browser plug-in  so that when I find a paper I want to use, I can navigate over to that button on the browser toolbar and press it. Then, I export it as a bibtex when writing my own papers in LaTex. 

Zotero is somewhat usable. by screenreader I can navigate through the previously selected paper titles and sort them into libraries by subject. Also, there are some hotkeys for example, command+shift+c to copy a already formatted citation. However, there is a long way to go for accessibility.

Let me know if you have any questions

Best,

Newton Nguyen

Hi Newton,

Thanks for mentioning the ability to export BibTeX with zotero. It reminded me of two things for those who want to use LaTeX/BibTeX:
1. Google scholar offers the option to generate a BibTeX citation for articles.
2. I have a bash script that generates BibTeX entries given pubMed IDs (for those of us who use pubMed for biology/medical research). Happy to share this.

There is a bibtex4word plugin that I tried that didn't seem accessible. However, this could be a cool project for someone to work on on github.

Kevin

Hello Dan,

Do you have the latest release of Firefox and JAWS?

In firefox, if you hit alt+ h, uparrow to "about Firefox", you will see the current version, and by tabbing, you will have the option to upgrade if a new version is available.

Hello Dan,

Do you have the latest release of Firefox and JAWS?

In firefox, if you hit alt+ h, uparrow to "about Firefox", you will see the
current version, and by tabbing, you will have the option to upgrade if a
new version is available.

It's barely working for me.  Very clunky and no links list or heading lists.

I don't know for sure, but suspect that JAWS 18 did not get this update.

Hi everyone,

I am curious if anyone is using Microsoft Edge? I currently have Google
Chrome set as my default, and have looked at the Edge browser, but I haven't
used it yet.

Hello Liz,

Edge sort of works under JAWS Version 2018.1803.24.  However, when I use Edge and JAWS, Edge is slow, and my alt+tab window shifting is slowed down.  For a while, I went back to Internet Explorer.  I have problems with the Chrome browser's ability to work with buttons, especially on Chase and Wells Fargo web sites.

Each persons experience may be different from my experiences.

No, you're right about Chrome; it works most of the time but still has some
issues.  You'd think that they would be fixed by now but Google has a habit
of introducing accessibility regressions every time they make something
actually work right.  Not to mention that using gmail, its own product, with
Chrome and NVDA is less than viable.

Subject: Re: [nfbcs] JAWS Now Supports Firefox Again

Hello Liz,

Edge sort of works under JAWS Version 2018.1803.24.  However, when I use
Edge and JAWS, Edge is slow, and my alt+tab window shifting is slowed down.
For a while, I went back to Internet Explorer.  I have problems with the
Chrome browser's ability to work with buttons, especially on Chase and Wells
Fargo web sites.

Each persons experience may be different from my experiences.

Hi everyone,

I am curious if anyone is using Microsoft Edge? I currently have Google
Chrome set as my default, and have looked at the Edge browser, but I haven't
used it yet.

I have downgraded to the Firefox ESr. Firefox recommends that.

Message-ID: <5ab50827.0422ed0a.92895.ca76@mx.google.com>

Hi,
Yes, I use Edge and love it.
It's currently enaccessible on Android 4.4.2, but I'm really hoping that Microsoft will fix that.

Thanks,
Jessica

Not countering your assertion, but curious about it: I've been using Chrome almost exclusively with both JAWS and NVDA for a month or two without serious issue, but there's probably a lot I don't bump into on an average day of
surfing. What sorts of problems have you seen or learned of with Chrome and NVDA?

No, you're right about Chrome; it works most of the time but still has some
issues.  You'd think that they would be fixed by now but Google has a habit
of introducing accessibility regressions every time they make something
actually work right.  Not to mention that using gmail, its own product, with
Chrome and NVDA is less than viable.

Hello Liz,

Edge sort of works under JAWS Version 2018.1803.24.  However, when I use
Edge and JAWS, Edge is slow, and my alt+tab window shifting is slowed down.
For a while, I went back to Internet Explorer.  I have problems with the
Chrome browser's ability to work with buttons, especially on Chase and Wells
Fargo web sites.

Each persons experience may be different from my experiences.

Hi everyone,

I am curious if anyone is using Microsoft Edge? I currently have Google
Chrome set as my default, and have looked at the Edge browser, but I haven't
used it yet.

I have downgraded to the Firefox ESr. Firefox recommends that.

If you use Microsoft Narrator, which has improve a great deal with the latet version of Windows 10, then Edge is the browser for you. In fact it is the only browser for you as Narrator does not work with Chrome or Firefox.

Subject: [nfbcs] JAWS Now Supports Firefox Again
Message-ID: <5ab52471.1c69fb81.3302a.4805@mx.google.com>

Thanks,
Jessica

Greetings:

My experience with Chrome has been mixed. I still have Firefox ESR as my default browser, and mostly it works. I think that the bad news is that the blind person who can flip between different browsers depending on what works better for the moment is the person with a better set of tools.

By May, when Firefox 60 comes out, we should see an improvement in compatibility between JAWS and Firefox.

Cordially,

Curtis Chong

Hi everyone,

I am curious if anyone is using Microsoft Edge? I currently have Google
Chrome set as my default, and have looked at the Edge browser, but I haven't

A combination between Chrome IE, Edge, NVDA, and JAWS should just about do
the job. My experience is that Firefox and Chrome are so similar that having
one covers both browsers.

Make sure the #accessibility hash tag is in your tweet too.  Earlier I 
had downloaded and installed their e-mail system and that was the Linux 
version and that was a waste of time and effort!

Subject: [nfbcs] Please Read This RE:  JAWS Now Supports Firefox Again
Message-ID: <001b01d3c322$a9e0c220$fda24660$@wavecable.com>

Some answers:

1.      JAWS: Firefox 59 only works with JAWS 2018. This is not an update
that you can download using the check for updates feature; you have to
download it from Freedom Scientific, and it probably counts as an SMA point.

2.      Slowness: If Firefox is being really slow, it is because, in trying
to make Firefox faster, they set a default that was supposed to help but
does not for most people. If you open the Windows task manager to find
anywhere from two to four Firefox processes, then this new feature is turned
on. Here is how to fix it:

a.       Open Firefox and type about:config in the address field.

b.      After pressing enter, press the button that says that you accept the
risk.

c.       Type autostart in the search field and tab to the list of results.

d.      Press the applications key or shift F10 to open the context menu and
press enter on the item that says toggle value.

e.       Restart Firefox.

3.      History and book marks: This happened to me, too-it seems to be more
likely on business computers. Fear not, though, they are not lost-just
hidden. Go to tools >> options. If using JAWS, turn off the virtual cursor.
Arrow to the privacy and security page-the new Firefox seems to jump to the
first item every time that the page changes, so you will have to tab back
and forth. Once there, tab to the box that says to use private mode and
uncheck it.

 

Please let me know if you have any other questions. I am not an expert on
Firefox, but I may be able to help solve some of the problems.

Yes, jaws 2018 is an upgrade, it's technically jaws 19 and superceeds
jaws 18. The goal is that it's now easier for people to know when their
version came out, at least that's what I presume and makes it easier to
know which version you have. Many updates to 2018 have been rolled out
recently.
Thanks,

I've found Firefox and Chrome behave differently in terms of their
interactions with JAWS and NVDA (even with the ESR version of Firefox) and
having one to use when the other fails has been helpful personally and in my
job. I'm curious to hear that Edge is a viable option: I've never had any
luck with it.

A combination between Chrome IE, Edge, NVDA, and JAWS should just about do
the job. My experience is that Firefox and Chrome are so similar that having
one covers both browsers.

Greetings:

My experience with Chrome has been mixed. I still have Firefox ESR as my
default browser, and mostly it works. I think that the bad news is that the
blind person who can flip between different browsers depending on what works
better for the moment is the person with a better set of tools.

By May, when Firefox 60 comes out, we should see an improvement in
compatibility between JAWS and Firefox.

Cordially,

Curtis Chong

Well pardon me, the issue with gmail and focus issues when selecting and
deleting messages seems to be fixed, so I spoke too soon on that one.  I
might have been a little unfair below towards Google, as honestly there are
issues with the experience using NVDA in both browsers.  It just seems like
whenever I'm experiencing a problem in Chrome, I can go to Firefox and it
works smoothly.  I think a few of the issues I am experiencing might be
specific to NVDA, such as stopping say all and finding my focus way farther
down the document than where it should be, and random jumping around the
page when arrowing through.  I'd say these manifested themselves in the last
year or so; they've not always been a problem.

Not countering your assertion, but curious about it: I've been using Chrome
almost exclusively with both JAWS and NVDA for a month or two without
serious issue, but there's probably a lot I don't bump into on an average
day of surfing. What sorts of problems have you seen or learned of with
Chrome and NVDA?

No, you're right about Chrome; it works most of the time but still has some
issues.  You'd think that they would be fixed by now but Google has a habit
of introducing accessibility regressions every time they make something
actually work right.  Not to mention that using gmail, its own product, with
Chrome and NVDA is less than viable.

Hello Liz,

Edge sort of works under JAWS Version 2018.1803.24.  However, when I use
Edge and JAWS, Edge is slow, and my alt+tab window shifting is slowed down.
For a while, I went back to Internet Explorer.  I have problems with the
Chrome browser's ability to work with buttons, especially on Chase and Wells
Fargo web sites.

Each persons experience may be different from my experiences.

Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.2.21.9.1803251551100.821@server2.shellworld.net>

Hi everyone:

I'm preparing to take a professional examination conducted by PSI. I've 
heard that they bought Pearson View, but unsure about that. The 
accommodations form states that they provide a reader/scribe, but does not 
mention Braille at all. Upon taking the exam, you immediately receive your 
license at the test site. The exam is done via computer instead of paper 
and pencil. However, my concern is that I would not a have a Braille copy 
of the test questions. I believe this is essential since the questions are 
designed to be tricky and need to be read multiple times to ensure the 
correct response is selected. Has anyone (including counselors) requested 
a Braille exam from PSI? If so, did it work out with the computer 
administration?
I apologize if I am posting to the wrong list, so please let me know if 
there is another list where this message could be posted. Thanks.

I believe we had an NFB member from Iowa take a test through Pearson. they had not offered Braille but she finally got it. no matter who the testing service is, I would request Braille. There is no precedent for Braille testing accommodation.

Greetings:

I believe that even though the test is computerized, it is reasonable to ask
for a braille copy of the questions. This may not be in the current playbook
for the testing organization, but surely some push can be provided to
"encourage" them to do the right thing<smile>.

Cordially,

Curtis Chong

Hi Curtis and all:
Thanks for the feedback. One of my questions is whether the test site 
would be able to get a Braille version of the exam that is an exact match 
of the computerized version. The main reason why that would be helpful 
would be the ability to be licensed the same day you take the test. If 
not, I'm willing to sacrifice that part for Braille, but it would be nice 
if I didn't have to.

Hi all! 
 My boy friend and I were talking about getting an accessable televition over the next month or so. The only two I know of are the one from Amazon and the Apple T.V. I don?t know much about this market. Does any one know more about these televitions and more about what?s out there?

The whole Phillips line (recent models) has the wheelchair symbol on 
their boxes and are all accessible.  There's an Element model that's 
accessible and one Samsung set I've read about that's accessible too. 
All of that reading happened over on the electronics-talk list strangely 
enough.
Hope this helps.

I've never done anything with climatology, but I'm happy to help answer
questions, give you pointers, whatever I can do. I used LaTex for all of
my math courses. Please feel free to get in touch.
Thanks,

Get an A M radio, put it on an empty frequency and place it near various parts of the computer. The sound of the whines, buzzes and burps can tell you a lot, especially when you have learned what "normal" sounds like. You probably won't experience dead silence even when the computer is off, because various power supplies will still be running and creating noise. This alternative technique also works in determining the state of cell phones, tablets, PC monitors, digital talking book players, etc.

Good question. I have the same issue and end up resorting to weird tests 
in order to figure out whether my laptop is on or not. I used to press the 
button on my cd drive, since the drive would generally open if the 
computer is on, except that now I have a laptop without a cd drive. 
Sometimes I'll plug my iPhone into my computer and observe whether it 
starts to charge, as a test to see whether the computer is on.

A light probe may help if you know where the laptop lights are and which 
one shows disk activity.

Buy a stethoscope and use it on the laptop.  If that's silent your laptop 
is either off or dead. On Tue, 27 Mar 2018, Tracy Carcione via nfbcs

I know Rocu has its own voice output. There is an article in a Braille Monitor from November or December by Carl Ballenger that describes them all well.

My technique is similar, though now without Radio Shack I haven't located alternative sources for these two items:

I bought a telephone pickup coil, also called an induction coil (looks like a suction cup on a microphone cable with a mini plug at the other end) and a $25.00 small battery-powered amplifier. I can use the coil-and-amp
combination to detect lots of things with more precision than an AM radio I think: CPU activity, drive (sometimes even SSD) activity, fan speed, router status and, to some extent, throughput, etc.

But each device is unique; you learn what yours sound like in various states.

If you have an unpowered USB hub, you can plug in a USB fan that will run when your computer is active.  

Another way is to use an iOS smart phone, and the Microsoft Seeing AI to look at your screen.  Using OCR applications on smart phones works some what.  My iPhone 6+ can only read a few words on the screen.

Good question. I have the same issue and end up resorting to weird tests in order to figure out whether my laptop is on or not. I used to press the button on my cd drive, since the drive would generally open if the computer is on, except that now I have a laptop without a cd drive. 
Sometimes I'll plug my iPhone into my computer and observe whether it starts to charge, as a test to see whether the computer is on.

I've tried just listening hard, but lately I've been using SeeingAI's Short
Text channel which is remarkably helpful. I put it in front of the screen
and it will read any text messages as they change.
This means you have to use a relatively recent iPhone though, which isn't in
the realm of possibility for everyone.

With the new silent disks, how do you know your computer is doing something,
when Jaws goes silent?  For instance, I have trouble making sure my new
laptop is on.  I can feel a tiny draft from the fan, but it's very subtle.
Or, just now, my old work desktop decided to do an automatic update, and
Jaws stopped talking.  The only way I knew the PC was still working was that
I could hear the disk spinning, and, when it rebooted after the update,
spinning for another few minutes before Jaws finally came up.
So, with the new silent discs, how do you know something is happening and
you should just wait a bit?

So I actually learned about this feature in IOS from another blind guy 
while sitting on top of a rock formation called The Sentinel in 
Mississippi Palasades State Park in Illinois. That's another interesting 
story. Anyway, In IOS, you can enable a feature that allows you to type 
as if you're using a braille keyboard. So to type the letter m, for 
example, you'd tap the index and ring finger on your left hand and the 
index finger on your right hand at the same time. That would be dots 1, 
3, and 4.

I have only just started using this feature myself and I got cramps in 
my hands just typing out that short first message. But I think I'll get 
better with practice.  I would say that when I get going, I am probably 
already faster than I am with the regular qwerty keyboard on my iphone. 
I can sometimes type a bunch of characters in a row. Then I get off the 
mark and it starts putting in nonsense characters. But at one point it 
put the integral symbol in the message so that is actually a good sign. 
I have no idea how I got it to do that though.

Enabling the braille keyboard is buried deep in the accessibility 
settings somewhere. Here is a link to a blog about it:
http://bdmtech.blogspot.com/2014/09/new-in-ios-8-built-in-braille-keyboard.html

Good afternoon,

 

I was wondering if anyone here has used or knows of any good and free tax
preparation software that works well with JAWS.  I have a super easy w2 form
for tax purposes, and I'd hate to go somewhere to be charged for doing taxes
if I can do it online.  I just don't know of any good and easy software that
can walk me through the tax prep process.

If anyone can help, please let me know.

Thanks!

Jim

While you're waiting for Tyler, I'll just say that I used on line 
tutorials and examples when learning LaTeX. For example, if I want to 
use LaTeX to write a personal letter, I'll Google for LaTeX and letters 
and find a ton of samples to choose from and use as a starting point. I 
use pdflatex to turn my LaTeX markup into a PDF document.

LaTeX is a MacPort. Not sure if it can be had also via Homebrew but I bet so. It's also available in Cygwin on Windows, and I'm sure via other means as well. I have it in Cygwin and on my Mac though I haven't had occasion to
use it much in many years. I used it regularly in college, but that was back when LaTeX files tended to start with \documentstyle rather than the more modern \documentclass. My knowledge of LaTeX syntax is therefore a bit out
of date. Nevertheless I always liked using it in college.

I do exactly the same things. I've been using latex since long before 
the world wide web existed but now a days, I google it. The wikibook on 
latex is an excellent place to start. After creating the doc in latex, I 
convert it to a pdf with pdflatex and that's the document I sent out. 
This is all linux, of course. That's another issue.

For MacOS users TeXshop is a free and accessible front end to LaTeX as well as all other forms of TeX. It is worth looking into. You will still need to install the TeX system but there are instructions for doing this at the TeXShop website http://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/texshop/

On windows, I have had success with MikTeX at the commandline, but not with the graphical version? Has anyone had success with the GUI? The commandline version is pretty easy to use and doesn't require much unix knowledge. 

A more annoying issue I am currently facing is editing documents with others who don't use LaTeX. I currently use latex2rtf to make an rtf file that others can edit with track changes and comments. However, I then have to incorporate these changes into a .tex file; the whole process is very inefficient. The only reason I am using LaTeX in these situations is (1) managing references (which there are many of in scientific articles) and (2) math. It would be soooo much better if there was a 100% accessible reference manager that could be used directly in microsoft word. However, I've found my inefficient system of using LaTeX and rtf files still more efficient than working with reference managers like endnote, mendeley, and zotero.

Thanks everyone! Also thanks to whoever changed the subject line.
I currently have MiKTeX, Winedt and Notepad++ installed and am making use of bookshare books and Google, but I've been spoiled with step-by-step courses in life so need to get used to a more self-directed way of learning. I also need to get over the intimidation factor. And learn how to use Winedt...
Thanks again!
Sarah

Hi,
I used Turbotax to do my taxes. It was accessible both from the computer 
and via the smartphone app. It was free; I think they only charge for extra 
stuff like having someone go over it before you file, or storing your 
documents in their system. I'm not really sure. All I know is I got to 
e-file for free so I was happy.

If you are a new college student, I can almost guarantee that one thing 
you will be shocked at is how much you are expected to do for yourself. 
It's a shock for nearly every freshman student and sometimes more so for 
disabled students who often have overly protective parents. A good 
example of how much you're expected to pick up on your own is latex 
itself. I used to teach a mini-course on latex at the University Of 
Wisconsin. But I don't do that anymore because students are expected to 
know it by the time they get here. And if they don't, they are expected 
to google it and get themselves up to speed.

By the way, the better the school, the more they are going to expect you 
to do on your own. Part of having high academic standards is demanding a 
lot from the students. A good school also has good safety nets but the 
school's reputation depends in part on putting out graduates who can 
make it in the real world. In the real world, you are going to have to 
take it a step further. You're going to be expected not only to pick 
things up on your ow, you are going to be expected to decide for 
yourself what you need to pick up. Maybe someday latex will be obsolete. 
You are going to be expected to recognize that and to  advise your 
employer to  switch to something new. It's even more true in academia 
where researchers are expected to break new ground all the time.

If you are interested in a career in technology, the best skills you can 
develop are those that allow you to learn things on your own. No question.

If you are a new college student, I can almost guarantee that one thing you will be shocked at is how much you are expected to do for yourself. 
It's a shock for nearly every freshman student and sometimes more so for disabled students who often have overly protective parents. A good example of how much you're expected to pick up on your own is latex itself. I used to teach a mini-course on latex at the University Of Wisconsin. But I don't do that anymore because students are expected to know it by the time they get here. And if they don't, they are expected to google it and get themselves up to speed.

By the way, the better the school, the more they are going to expect you to do on your own. Part of having high academic standards is demanding a lot from the students. A good school also has good safety nets but the school's reputation depends in part on putting out graduates who can make it in the real world. In the real world, you are going to have to take it a step further. You're going to be expected not only to pick things up on your ow, you are going to be expected to decide for yourself what you need to pick up. Maybe someday latex will be obsolete. 
You are going to be expected to recognize that and to  advise your employer to  switch to something new. It's even more true in academia where researchers are expected to break new ground all the time.

If you are interested in a career in technology, the best skills you can develop are those that allow you to learn things on your own. No question.

My technique is similar, though now without Radio Shack I haven't located
alternative sources for these two items:

I bought a telephone pickup coil, also called an induction coil (looks like
a suction cup on a microphone cable with a mini plug at the other end) and a
$25.00 small battery-powered amplifier. I can use the coil-and-amp
combination to detect lots of things with more precision than an AM radio I
think: CPU activity, drive (sometimes even SSD) activity, fan speed, router
status and, to some extent, throughput, etc.

But each device is unique; you learn what yours sound like in various
states.

because various power supplies will still be running and creating noise.
This alternative technique also works in determining the state of cell
phones, tablets, PC monitors, digital talking book players, etc.

With the new silent disks, how do you know your computer is doing something,
when Jaws goes silent?  For instance, I have trouble making sure my new
laptop is on.  I can feel a tiny draft from the fan, but it's very subtle.
Or, just now, my old work desktop decided to do an automatic update, and
Jaws stopped talking.  The only way I knew the PC was still working was that
I could hear the disk spinning, and, when it rebooted after the update,
spinning for another few minutes before Jaws finally came up.
So, with the new silent discs, how do you know something is happening and
you should just wait a bit?

Ok, to try and carve a reasonable path between these last two... :)

John's final point is valid: The skill of knowing how to learn on your own is indispensable in today's world.

But that does not mean it is wrong to seek help. Collaboration skills, part of which is team skills, are also invaluable nowadays. One would hope that, where you ask for help in one area, you may find ways to give help in
another.

As an aside, it is news to me that any school requires LaTeX for all students.

Many years ago, I thought of crafting a presentation called "The Two Kinds of 'Fair'." I never got round to it, but here's the basic idea - and college and would-be college students, please read this:

The following is my experience. Your mileage may vary of course.

In high school, an assignment would be handed out to the class in print. Simultaneously, I would receive a Braille copy. The students would be required, during class or at home or whatever, to complete the assignment and turn
it in, again in print. I was required, within the same timeframe, to turn in a Braille copy of my work. This is, of course, fair. Specifically, it is fair to me.

However...

In college, an assignment was handed out in print. I received the same print copy. The assignment, again, was to be carried out and turned in, in print. I was to turn in a print copy at the same time everyone else did. This, of
course, is fair. Specifically, this is fair to the rest of the class.

But also, of course, it is very different!

So... John's point, put perhaps more delicately, is that the second kind of "fair" really does take over out there, in college often enough but absolutely in employment. Ongoing accessibility work is of course bridging the gap
between the two kinds of fair; but there will always be cases where the difference remains. The second kind of fair, I say, weighs more in the balance after high school because, strictly from a mathematical standpoint, it
is "fair" to more people. This is not a moral defense; it is just an observation. This is precisely the reason we work so hard to make things accessible, so that what is fair to them also becomes fair for us.

If you are a new college student, I can almost guarantee that one thing you will be shocked at is how much you are expected to do for yourself. 
It's a shock for nearly every freshman student and sometimes more so for disabled students who often have overly protective parents. A good example of how much you're expected to pick up on your own is latex itself. I used to teach a mini-course on latex at the University Of Wisconsin. But I don't do that anymore because students are expected to know it by the time they get here. And if they don't, they are expected to google it and get themselves up to speed.

By the way, the better the school, the more they are going to expect you to do on your own. Part of having high academic standards is demanding a lot from the students. A good school also has good safety nets but the school's reputation depends in part on putting out graduates who can make it in the real world. In the real world, you are going to have to take it a step further. You're going to be expected not only to pick things up on your ow, you are going to be expected to decide for yourself what you need to pick up. Maybe someday latex will be obsolete. 
You are going to be expected to recognize that and to  advise your employer to  switch to something new. It's even more true in academia where researchers are expected to break new ground all the time.

If you are interested in a career in technology, the best skills you can develop are those that allow you to learn things on your own. No question.

For me, latex was not required in any of my classes for my bachelors degree. I?m doing a masters degree now, it has not been required for that either.

Just to be clear, I didn't say all students are expected to know latex. 
Lots of students have no need for latex. My point was that I think it is 
probably typical for students who need to use latex to be expected to 
pick  it up on their own.  But even that might be different in other 
schools.

I am not sure what you are saying but I would bet my house that you are 
disputing a point I never made. If you think that I was saying you are 
on your own when it comes to accessibility issues, you couldn't be 
further from the truth. I believe that instructors have a legal 
obligation to make class materials accessible. But I know they have an 
ethical obligation to do so. I have been trying to start a mentoring 
program for disabled students at the University Of Wisconsin because I 
heard so many horror stories from students at other universities. 
Sometimes instructors seem to think a student's accessibility issues are 
not their problem. I once heard from a student who said her instructor 
said he didn't see why her disability should make extra work for him. 
IMO, an instructor like that ought to be fired. That ought to be grounds 
for dismissal.

But just to be clear, this is completely tangential to the point I was 
making.

Well, again, I wasn't saying you have to know latex. I was saying that 
it's typical for a school to expect you to pick it up on your own if you 
need to know it.

But do you mean to say that you didn't need to know latex for a Comp Sci 
degree? I will admit I am a little surprised by that but not shocked. I 
know that kind of thing varies greatly from school to school. In fact, 
my department once hired a guy who had gotten a Comp Sci degree 
withoutlearning a programming language. He had never written a computer 
program the entire time he was in college. I was on the team that 
interviewed him and, frankly, I never even thought to ask that. Of 
course, latex is nothing like that. The vast majority of jobs don't 
require you to know latex. It's in wide use in academic circles though.

So I am guessing your school uses Microsoft products? You do your papers 
in Word? I just met with some instructors of blind students at the high 
school level and they said they have their kids do their papers in latex 
and convert them to pdf when submitting them to the teacher. I 
personally do it that way for the papers I write professionally. But 
most of the world uses Microsoft Word.

Morphing this thread for at least the second time...

There has been discussion here of using LaTeX to create PDF output. I'm wondering which if any tools for this generate PDF output that is properly accessible--i.e., well tagged and structured.

But do you mean to say that you didn't need to know latex for a Comp Sci
degree? I will admit I am a little surprised by that but not shocked. I know
that kind of thing varies greatly from school to school. In fact, my
department once hired a guy who had gotten a Comp Sci degree withoutlearning a
programming language. He had never written a computer program the entire time
he was in college. I was on the team that interviewed him and, frankly, I
never even thought to ask that. Of course, latex is nothing like that. The
vast majority of jobs don't require you to know latex. It's in wide use in
academic circles though.

So I am guessing your school uses Microsoft products? You do your papers in
Word? I just met with some instructors of blind students at the high school
level and they said they have their kids do their papers in latex and convert
them to pdf when submitting them to the teacher. I personally do it that way
for the papers I write professionally. But most of the world uses Microsoft
Word.

A good example of how much you're expected to pick up on your own is latex itself. I used to teach a mini-course on latex at the University Of Wisconsin. But I don't do that anymore because students are expected to know it by the time they get here. And if they don't, they are expected to google it and get themselves up to speed.

A good school also has good safety nets but the school's reputation depends in part on putting out graduates who can make it in the real world. In the real world, you are going to have to take it a step further. You're going to be expected not only to pick things up on your ow, you are going to be expected to decide for yourself what you need to pick up. Maybe someday latex will be obsolete.

I agree that there are probably going to be things that students will be 
expected to pick up on their own. For instance, my college didn't, say, 
have a class to teach Unix, but knowing it was required for various 
classes. Professors may have given basic guidance as needed, and everyone 
was in the same boat, in terms of needing to learn it if they didn't know 
it already. I probably could have got my BS degree without ever learning 
LaTeX, using MS Word to write papers, except that I had 
accessibility-related reasons for at least needing to be able to read it 
and also rarely used Windows.

Hi,

That's odd that you need to know unix for other classes and they don't offer
an intro to unix class.

But this is the point I've been trying to make. I don't know about 
linux/unix specifically but it doesn't surprise me that you might be 
expected to pick that up on your own. The basic problem is that there 
are only so many chairs in every classroom. Every year, every decent 
university in the country gets way more applications than they can take. 
The competition for admission can be harsh. At one time, you had to have 
a 3.2 high school GPA to get into the University Of Wisconsin. Well, you 
could get past that based on many other factors. But 3.2 was the basic 
cut off point. This is the state university of Wisconsin and that was 
considered to be a huge problem.

No university likes turning students away. So they do their best to get 
each student through in 4 years. If a student takes 5 years to get his 
degree, that means there is no room for some other student. The result 
is a trend toward asking students to learn more and more on their own. 
Also driving this trend are foreign students who often are much more

College has always been a big step for most people. Like I said in 
another message, for many people it is the first time in their lives 
when they have been expected to get their own butt out of bed in the

expecting students to take the initiative on what they are learning 
outside of class and the level of competition at most schools and it can 
be brutal.

But this isn't all bad. Learning to show initiative makes you a happier, 
healthier person.  Learning to show initiative is a valuable skill for 
anybody but especially for a disabled person. In your life, there is 
never going to be any better advocate for you than you. Nobody else is 
going to understand your needs more than you. Nobody is going to care 
more about your needs than you.

John makes some very good points here.  I would add that much of what he
says applies to one's employment as well.  Learning how to pick up skills
independently is something that will be of use on the job as well.

Best regards,

Steve Jacobson

But this is the point I've been trying to make. I don't know about 
linux/unix specifically but it doesn't surprise me that you might be 
expected to pick that up on your own. The basic problem is that there 
are only so many chairs in every classroom. Every year, every decent 
university in the country gets way more applications than they can take. 
The competition for admission can be harsh. At one time, you had to have 
a 3.2 high school GPA to get into the University Of Wisconsin. Well, you 
could get past that based on many other factors. But 3.2 was the basic 
cut off point. This is the state university of Wisconsin and that was 
considered to be a huge problem.

No university likes turning students away. So they do their best to get 
each student through in 4 years. If a student takes 5 years to get his 
degree, that means there is no room for some other student. The result 
is a trend toward asking students to learn more and more on their own. 
Also driving this trend are foreign students who often are much more 
willing to put in long hours than their American counterparts. Yet 
another factor is the move away from "grade inflation". During the 
Vietnam war,professors would bend over backward to avoid failing a 
student for fear it would make him eligible for the draft. The methods 
they used to avoid that lasted for decades past the war and are only now 
fading away. The net result of all of these things is greater 
competition and ever increasing demands on students.

College has always been a big step for most people. Like I said in 
another message, for many people it is the first time in their lives 
when they have been expected to get their own butt out of bed in the 
morning. But now you can add to that an increasing trend toward 
expecting students to take the initiative on what they are learning 
outside of class and the level of competition at most schools and it can 
be brutal.

But this isn't all bad. Learning to show initiative makes you a happier, 
healthier person.  Learning to show initiative is a valuable skill for 
anybody but especially for a disabled person. In your life, there is 
never going to be any better advocate for you than you. Nobody else is 
going to understand your needs more than you. Nobody is going to care 
more about your needs than you.
